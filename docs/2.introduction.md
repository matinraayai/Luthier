# Introduction

## What is Luthier?

Luthier is a tool for instrumenting AMD GPU code objects. For now, it supports dynamic instrumentation, allowing a
tool writer to:

- View and analyze the instructions and basic blocks in a kernel.
- Insert (multiple) calls to "hooks" inside the code between instructions, written with HIP as device functions.
- Remove/modify/add instructions of the original app.
- Query/modify the ISA visible state on the device side, and recording them on a piece of memory allocated by the tool.

We plan to expand Luthier's capabilities to also include other use cases like static instrumentation; But for now,
dynamic instrumentation is our top priority.

## What AMD GPU Applications Luthier Supports?

Luthier supports any AMD GPU programming API in Linux that is built on the 
[ROCm runtime (ROCr)](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCR-Runtime/).
This should include both frequently used runtimes like HIP, OpenMP, OpenCL, and even less popular ones, like
AMDGPU.jl.

Luthier does not support the [Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL)](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/pal) or Mesa-based backends yet,
and does not get tested on Windows.

## How does Luthier work?

Luthier works similarly to [NVBit](https://github.com/NVlabs/NVBit) and
[GTPin](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/gtpin/index.html), but with a few key differences in its design
and abstractions to work with AMD GPUs. Before diving into how different Luthier components work,
we briefly have to introduce the following terms:

- __AMD GPU Code Object__: An ELF shared object file that can be loaded and run on AMD GPUs. Its specifications are
  described in depth by the [LLVM AMDGPU Backend Documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html). Each AMD GPU
  code object roughly has a one-to-one relationship with a HIP Module (`hipModule_t`). Each launched kernel belongs
  to an AMD GPU code object loaded onto a device.
- __Target Application__: An AMD GPU application to be instrumented. The target application contains API calls
  to an AMD GPU runtime (e.g. HIP), loads AMD GPU code objects onto the GPU, and launches kernels.
- __Instrumentation Hook__: A HIP ```__device__``` function written by a tool writer. It can be injected before or
  after instructions of a kernel or a device function. Hooks get inlined, and use Luthier intrinsics allowing access 
- to the GPU's ISA visible state.
- __Luthier Intrinsics__: A set of dummy device functions that provide Luthier hooks a way to use assembly 
  instructions without using inline assembly. They are a similar concept to LLVM intrinsics, but are implemented 
  without extending the backend manually on top of the normal LLVM compilation pipeline.
- __Target Kernel__: The un-instrumented kernel of the target application.
- __Instrumented Kernel__: The instrumented version of a target kernel.

### The HIP/HSA API Interception Layer

At the very bottom, Luthier has a HIP/HSA API interception layer. Similar to NVBit, Luthier uses the ```LD_PRELOAD```
trick to load before any of the ROCm libraries. When loaded, Luthier uses the [rocprofiler-sdk](https://github.com/rocm/rocprofiler-sdk) API to install
callbacks over the HIP/HSA API tables to intercept their calls. Callbacks only happen when either Luthier or the tool
explicitly require them for a specific API or event.

At the bare minimum, Luthier requires the intercepting the HSA API table for critical functionality,
and the HIP compiler API table to import hook host handles. Luthier only provides the HIP runtime API interceptor for
convenient user facing functionality if required. See [HSA Interceptor](3.hsa.md#hsa-interceptor),
[HIP Runtime API Interceptor](4.hip.md#hip-runtime-api-interceptor), and
[HIP Compiler API Interceptor](4.hip.md#hip-compiler-api-interceptor) for more details on how each API interceptor works.

### What is HSA? Why Rely on HSA Instead of HIP?
In a nutshell, HSA (also referred to as the ROCm Runtime or ROCr for short) is the equivalent of the CUDA Driver API 
for AMD GPUs. See [The HSA Namespace](3.hsa.md#the-hsa-namespace) for more details on HSA and its role in Luthier. 
The reason we rely on HSA is the same reason NVBit relies on the CUDA Driver API: it is the lowest common layer of 
programming AMD GPUs for compute programs in ROCm. This means that almost all compute runtimes rely primarily on HSA 
to load and launch code on the device. To cover as many potential applications as possible, and leverage the additional 
low-level info made available, Luthier uses HSA for instrumentation. 

## Intercepting Kernel Launches

Unlike the CUDA driver API, where a kernel is launched by calling a set of functions, AMD GPUs use memory mapped 
software queues as an abstraction over the GPU's command processor. To launch a kernel on the GPU, an application 
must request a queue from the runtime and write a kernel dispatch packet to the queue's memory. The driver then submits
the packet to the command processor asynchronously.

As there is no explicit function to capture for kernel launches, HSA provides something called an `Intercept Queue`
which wraps around the normal memory-mapped queue. Instead of writing packets directly into the queue's memory, it holds
on to it and provides a callback right before the packet is submitted to the real queue.

To allow interception of all packets sent to the GPUs at all times, Luthier always intercepts all calls to queue creation 
functions and replaces them with a call to create an `Intercept Queue` instead. The `Intercept Queue` will then invokes
a callback when a packet is about to be submitted, if the tool writer has enabled it.

## Code Object Disassembly and "Lifting" to LLVM Machine IR


## How to write a Tool with Luthier:

The following is a high-level example of how a tool for Luthier is written:

```c++
#include <luthier.h>
#include <hip/hip_runtime_api.h>
#include <hsa/hsa.h>

MARK_LUTHIER_DEVICE_MODULE

__managed__ int GlobalCounter = 0;

 __device__ __noinline__ extern "C" void instrumentation_kernel() {
    *GlobalCounter = *GlobalCounter + 1;
}

LUTHIER_EXPORT_FUNC(instrumentation_kernel)

void instrumentKernelLaunchCallback(hsa_kernel_dispatch_packet_t packet) {
     if (not luthier_is_instrumented(packet->kernel_object)) {
         std::vector<Instr> instrVec = luthier_disassemble_kernel_object(packet->kernel_object);
         for (const auto& instr: instrVec) {
             luthier_insert_call(instr, LUTHIER_GET_HOOK_HANDLE(instrumentation_kernel), LUTHIER_IPOINT_AFTER);
         }
        luthier_override_with_instrumented(dispatchPacket);
     }
}

void luthier_at_init() {
    fprintf(stdout, "Instruction Counter Tool is launching.\n");
}


void luthier_at_term() {
     fprintf(stdout, "Number of instructions executed: %d\n", GlobalCounter);
     fprintf(stdout, "Instruction Counter Tool is terminating!\n");
}


void luthier_at_hsa_event(hsa_api_args_t* args, luthier_api_phase_t phase, hsa_api_id_t api_id) {
    if (phase == LUTHIER_API_PHASE_ENTER) {
        if (api_id == HSA_EVT_ID_KERNEL_LAUNCH) {
            fprintf(stdout, "<Intercepted kernel launch.\n");
            instrumentKernelLaunchCallback(args->hsa_evt_kernel_launch.dispatch_packet);
            }
    }
}

void atHipEvt(void* args, luthier_api_phase_t phase, int hip_api_id) {}
```

A few notable points:

1. When making device-side instrumentation tools with Luthier, the macro ```MARK_LUTHIER_DEVICE_MODULE``` must be called
   once. This will help Luthier identify the Hip Module compiled with the tool and keep track of it.
2. A device function that will be injected between instructions in Luthier needs to be "exported" using
   ```LUTHIER_EXPORT_FUNC```. This will prevent the HIP compiler from eliminating the device function that "seemingly"
   is
   not used inside a kernel.
   ```LUTHIER_EXPORT_FUNC``` is just a kernel that wraps around the instrumentation function, and calls it without
   giving it any arguments. The kernel itself is not used to launch workloads on the GPU. However, Luthier uses the
   "Shadow Host Pointer" associated with the wrapper kernel to keep track of its instrumentation function.
   the compiler from eliminating the device function. See [Code Object Manager](#code-object-manager).
3. The tool writer needs to define two sets of callbacks, one for HSA and one for HIP. In the example tool, the HIP
   callback doesn't do anything. The HSA callback, on kernel launch, provides the ```hsa_kernel_dispatch_packet_t```,
   which is used to launch the kernel, and uses it to instrumentAndLoad the "kernel object" (address to where the kernel
   is
   located on the device).
4. The tool writer can get lift the instruction in the kernel object with the ```luthier_disassemble_kernel_object```
   function.
5. Finally, to insert a call to the instrumentation function, one can use the ```luthier_insert_call``` function.
   ```LUTHIER_GET_HOOK_HANDLE``` will get a handle to the wrapper kernel of the instrumented function. See
   [Code Object Manager](#code-object-manager) for why.
6. Optionally, one can add arguments to the instrumentation function, but here is not required. Unlike NVBit, Luthier
   instrumentation functions can use both statically and dynamically allocated memory on the GPU directly. To see
   how this is done, see [Code Object Manager](#code-object-manager).

As of right now, writing tools in HIP is only supported; But we plan to add more ways of writing tools for Luthier in
the future.

### Why Not Use the RocTracer and RocProfiler APIs for Capturing HIP/HSA APIs?

There are three reasons Luthier re-implemented what was available in RocTracer and RocProfiler:

1. The tracing and profiling libraries enforce ```const```-ness of their callback arguments, preventing an
   instrumentation tool like Luthier to modify them.
2. The Tracing API does not capture a set of necessary functions required for Luthier to function, including the family
   of ```__hipRegister``` functions called during startup of a HIP application.
3. Some internal functionality of Luthier (e.g. loading instrumentation code) requires HIP APIs to be prevented from
   executing. The RocTracer API does not allow for such freedom.

## Code Object Manager

The code object manager keeps track of the following and their respective code objects:

- The HSA executables of the instrumented kernels, plus their HSA executable symbols (and their kernel descriptors)
- The HSA executables of instrumentation functions loaded from the Luthier tool, where their instrumentation functions
  are located (as of right now HSA doesn't support indirect function symbols), as well as the HSA executable symbol
  associated with the wrapper kernels of the instrumentation function.

### Tool Code Object Loading

Unlike NVBit, Luthier doesn't have a dedicated "Tool Functions Loader". Luthier tools are compiled with HIP, therefore
during startup, they use the ```__hipRegister``` function family (```__hipRegisterFatBinary```,
```__hipRegisterFunction```, ```__hipRegisterManagedVar```, ```__hipRegisterSurface```, ```__hipRegisterTexture```,
and ```__hipRegisterVar```) to load their FAT binary to the HIP runtime.

Internally, Luthier modifies the normal loading procedure of FAT Binaries. It first identifies if the FAT Binary being
registered is part of a Luthier tool. The macro ```MARK_LUTHIER_DEVICE_MODULE``` creates a dummy static managed variable
in the FAT Binary associated with a Luthier tool, which can be easily identified when the arguments to
```__hipRegisterManagedVar``` are captured.

If a Luthier FAT binary is identified, its FAT binary and all its static variable types are allowed to register
normally.
The kernels, however, (arguments of ```__hipRegisterFunction```) are not registered with the HIP runtime, since the
kernels in Luthier modules are not meant for launching in the first place. Instead of  
registering the kernels with the HIP runtime, the kernels are registered with the Code Object Manager to keep track of
them.

Other FAT binaries that don't belong to Luthier are loaded normally.

Using the HIP runtime to load instrumentation functions associated with Luthier has the following benefits:

1. Not using the HIP runtime to load Luthier FAT Binaries would mean replicating the same loading logic on the Luthier
   side (which in and out of itself is very complicated task),
   diverting precious development and maintenance time away from more important parts of Luthier.
2. Registering with the HIP runtime means that (unlike NVBit),
   the tool writers can freely use HIP language constructs like static and
   dynamic, managed and device variables in their instrumentation functions. It also means that the Code Object Manager
   can use the same "Shadow Host Pointer" of the constructs to keep track of them. For example, when Adding arguments to
   their instrumentation functions, the tool writer doesn't need to use the "string" name of the arguments they want to
   add, they can simply use the variable directly. It also pushes issues with tool variables
   not being defined to compile time. A similar approach is used with referring to device function, using the
   ```LUTHIER_GET_EXPORTED_FUNCTION``` macro.

The ```__hipRegister``` function family is meant to load static code objects to the HIP runtime. The HIP runtime has a
policy of loading the FAT Binaries in a "lazy" fashion, meaning that it will only load a FAT binary into HSA ONLY IF
it requires to use a variable or a kernel associated with it. The only exception to this rule is if a static managed
variable is included in the device module, which will force the module to be loaded as soon as any kernel is launched
from HIP. This is a problem for Luthier, as it means the instrumentation functions will not be loaded onto the device.

To remedy this issue, the ```MARK_LUTHIER_DEVICE``` module defines a managed dummy variable in Luthier FAT Binaries.
Besides being used to identify FAT Binaries of Luthier, it is used to force the HIP runtime to load Luthier modules
eagerly. To have control over when Luthier modules are loaded, a dummy ```nullptr_t``` kernel is called by Luthier in
HIP, triggering the loading of Luthier HIP FAT binaries into HSA.

## How Does Luthier Instrument AMD GPU Device Code?

![](Luthier%20Instrumentation%20Diagram.png)

AMD's HSA implementation
(also called the ROCm runtime, or ROCr for short) is generally present as the lowest programmable level in the
ROCm compute stack on Linux platforms. Any other higher-level runtime such as HIP's AMD runtime or OpenCL (both at the
time of writing shipped under the [CLR](https://github.com/ROCm/clr) repository) or OpenMP build on top of
the ROCr runtime. As ROCr is usually the common denominator among all things ROCm, Luthier primarily works at the HSA
level to intercept and query the status of the application and carry out its instrumentation tasks.

*Note that ROCr is not always the lowest level of programing AMD GPUs for compute kernels:*

1. ROCr itself is built on top of the [ROCT Thunk Interface](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCT-Thunk-Interface) (or HSAKmt).
   HSAKmt is the user-level interface to the Linux ROCk driver. Much like ROCr, ROCT can be used by any arbitrary
   application. In theory, one can use ROCT to create their own compute runtime for AMD GPUs, which Luthier cannot
   handle.

   Additionally, AMD ships ROCT as a static library, and the default build of ROCr links against this static library.
   This makes the matter of using ROCT in Luthier much more complicated as:
    1. It is much harder to intercept calls to ROCT.
    2. Each instance of a ROCT-based runtime is provided a different "view"

2. Although, at the time of writing, ROCr is the primary runtime shipped with ROCm on Linux platforms, it is not
   the only runtime developed by AMD for compute kernels. GPUOpen's
   [Platform Abstraction Library (PAL)](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/pal), as described
   [here](https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#target-triples), is shipped for Windows and Linux Pro, which also
   supports
   executing code for the HSA runtime. Targeting the PAL runtime for instrumentation has not yet been explored in
   Luthier's development.
