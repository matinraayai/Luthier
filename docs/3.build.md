# Building and Running Luthier

## Requirements

### Supported AMD GPUs

At the time of writing Luthier has been developed and tested on an AMD Instinct MI 100, a CDNA 1 GPU. No other AMD GPUs
have been tested with Luthier yet. Other CDNA GPUs might not work due to bugs; RDNA GPUs might also not work due to
bugs, and some hardware differences currently not taken into account. As development progresses, we will add support
for more GPUs.

### Operating System

Luthier should build and run on any Linux-based distribution with ROCm support. At the time of writing, AMD officially
distributes ROCm for Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and SUSE Linux(see
[ROCm Installation Options](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/tutorial/install-overview.html)
). Other distributions (e.g. Arch) might also have support either in their official repositories or community-maintained
repositories.

Luthier currently does not support Windows; This might change in the future.

### Required Non-ROCm Software

1. **[CMake](https://cmake.org/)** is used as the build system for Luthier. **[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)** is 
   the preferred CMake generator for Luthier; But any other generator e.g. 
   **[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)** should also work. The [CMakeLists.txt](../CMakeLists.txt) file for
   Luthier is located at the top-level directory of the project. **CMake v3.21 and above** is required, since it is 
   the earliest version that supports HIP as a language with built-in HIP/ROCm-specific CMake variables.
2. **A C/C++ compiler**, like [GNU GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) for compiling the host
   portion of Luthier.
3. A Python 3 interpreter, with Python packages **[CXX Header Parser](https://github.com/robotpy/cxxheaderparser)** and
   **[PCPP](https://github.com/ned14/pcpp)** are used to generate wrappers for HSA and HIP API 
   functions.

### Required ROCm Software

1. **[AMDGPU DKMS](https://docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/how-to/native-install/ubuntu.html#register-kernel-mode-driver)** 
   is the kernel-mode driver for AMD GPUs. Without this, no ROCm-based application is able to run
   on the system.
2. **[AMD Code Object Manager Library (COMGR)](https://github.com/ROCm/llvm-project/tree/amd-staging/amd/comgr)** 
   is used for linking the object files generated by Luthier into HSA executables at runtime.
3. **[ROCm Runtime Library (ROCr)](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCR-Runtime)** is required to run AMDGPU compute applications on Linux systems. 
   Luthier monitors and intercept calls to ROCr by the target application (including kernel launches) to 
   instrument its device code and manage its execution.
4. **[AMD Compute Language Runtimes](https://github.com/ROCm/clr)** provides the runtime for AMD's
   Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability (HIP). Luthier requires the HIP runtime to write and load 
   user-written device functions for instrumentation.
5. **[LLVM](https://llvm.org/)** is the main driving force of Luthier instrumentation. LLVM and the LLVM AMD GPU backend is used for 
   inspecting and instrumenting the target application's code objects during runtime. 
   LLVM's standard libraries (e.g. `ADT`, string format, etc.) are also widely used across Luthier.
   At the time of writing Luthier does not use the LLVM shipped with the ROCm stack, and opts to use the latest ROCm 
   LLVM (version 21, at the time of writing) from the [amd-staging](https://github.com/ROCm/llvm-project/tree/amd-staging) branch; This is because:
    1. Luthier depends on features that have been recently introduced to LLVM e.g. support for the new pass manager in 
       the CodeGen layer.
    2. ROCm LLVM does not ship with Runtime Type Information (RTTI) enabled. Luthier uses RTTI-backed features in LLVM
       for things like error checking, note section parsing, and string formating.
   
   Luthier also requires **the source code of the LLVM project** during its build. This is because:
    1. The AMDGPU target tablegen records for the instructions and registers are only available in the LLVM source 
       code.
    2. The concrete interface headers of target-agnostic CodeGen classes for the AMDGPU backend (e.g.
       `llvm::SIMachineFunctionInfo`) are only available inside the LLVM source code and are required for correct 
       functionality of Luthier.
   
   LLVM source code is not needed for writing and running Luthier tools, as all the required files
   will be installed under Luthier's include directory.
6. **[Clang Compiler](https://clang.llvm.org/)** is used to compile Luthier tools, primarily their device portion.
   It must be built against the same LLVM version used to build Luthier itself, otherwise the version mismatch
   might cause segfaults with Luthier's compiler plugins during builds.
7. **[ROCm Device Library](https://github.com/ROCm/llvm-project/tree/amd-staging/amd/device-libs)**
   is a library of AMD specific device-side language runtime libraries needed by the Clang compiler used to compile 
   Luthier and its tools.
8. **[ROCProfiler SDK](https://github.com/rocm/rocprofiler-sdk)** is used to capture the HIP and HSA API tables and 
   install callbacks to monitor application execution. It can also be used to pair advanced profiling features with
   Luthier's instrumentation capabilities.

**Luthier requires ROCm version 6.2.2+, and supports instrumenting Code Object V3+**. 

## Build Options

### Luthier-specific CMake Options
- **```LUTHIER_LLVM_SRC_DIR```**: If set, should point to the source code directory of the LLVM binary Luthier is
  being built against. If not specified, Luthier will inspect the `llvm/Support/VCSRevision.h` header file of the 
  LLVM binary and downloads the associated source code revision automatically as an external resource.
- **```LUTHIER_BUILD_EXAMPLES```**: Builds the example tools under the [examples](../examples) folder if set to
  ```ON```. It is enabled by default.
- **```LUTHIER_BUILD_UNIT_TESTS```**: Builds Luthier's unit test set to ```ON```. Disabled
  by default.
- **```LUTHIER_BUILD_INTEGRATION_TESTS```**: Builds Luthier's integration test if set to ```ON```. Disabled
  by default.
- **```LUTHIER_BUILD_LATEX_DOCS```**: Builds Luthier's documentation in PDF format with Doxygen using Latex if set to
  ```ON```; Disabled by default. TODO: Describe Latex dependencies and procedure.
- **```LUTHIER_BUILD_HTML_DOCS```**: Builds Luthier's documentation in HTML format with Doxygen if set to ```ON```;
  Disabled by default. TODO: Describe documentation build procedure.

### Useful CMake Options and Commands
Refer to [CMake docs](https://cmake.org/documentation/) for more information.

- **```CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH```** is a list of `;`-separated paths that CMake will recursively search to locate 
  requested packages via `find_package`. Earlier specified paths take priority.
- **```{PACKAGE_NAME}_DIR```**, with `PACKAGE_NAME` replaced with the name of the package (e.g. `hip`) can force
  CMake to locate the config file of the package under the given directory and ignore all other hints.
- **```CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER```**, **```CMAKE_C_COMPILER```**, and **```CMAKE_HIP_COMPILER```** set the path to the
  desired C/C++/HIP compiler.
- **```-G```** sets the build configuration generator for CMake (e.g., ninja).
- **```CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE```** controls the build type for both host and device code. Debug information can be enabled
    if set to ```Debug``` or ```RelWithDebugInfo```.
- **```cmake --build . -v --```** prints each individual build step executed for a target. 
  Useful for debugging the build process.

## Build Instructions

> [!NOTE]
> `/opt/luthier/` is the assumed installation prefix for Luthier and its requirements.
>  You don't have to follow this convention.

1. Ensure all requirements are met (besides LLVM and Clang); See [Build Requirements](#build-requirements) and 
   [ROCm Installation Instructions](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/index.html).
2. Ensure that compiler and LLVM requirements of Luthier are met:
   1. Clone the `amd-staging` of the ROCm fork of the LLVM project:
      ```bash
      git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ROCm/llvm-project/
      ```
   2. Configure, build, and install the required components from the LLVM project (Ninja is used to generate the 
      build files here):
      ```bash
      mkdir llvm-project/build && cd llvm-project/build &&  \
      cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/luthier/llvm/  \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="AMDGPU;X86"  \
      -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="llvm;clang;lld;compiler-rt;clang-tools-extra" \
      -DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES="libcxx;libcxxabi;libunwind" \
      -DLLVM_ENABLE_EXPENSIVE_CHECKS=OFF \
      -DLIBCXX_ENABLE_SHARED=OFF \
      -DLIBCXX_ENABLE_STATIC=ON \
      -DLIBCXX_INSTALL_LIBRARY=OFF \
      -DLIBCXX_INSTALL_HEADERS=OFF \
      -DLIBCXXABI_ENABLE_SHARED=OFF \
      -DLIBCXXABI_ENABLE_STATIC=ON \
      -DLIBCXXABI_INSTALL_STATIC_LIBRARY=OFF \
      -DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON \
      -DLLVM_OPTIMIZED_TABLEGEN=ON \
      -DCLANG_ENABLE_AMDCLANG=ON \
      -DLLVM_BUILD_TOOLS=ON \
      -DLLVM_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF \
      -DLLVM_INCLUDE_BENCHMARKS=OFF \
      -DLLVM_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
      -DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF \
      -DCLANG_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF \
      -DLLVM_BUILD_DOCS=OFF \
      -DLLVM_ENABLE_SPHINX=OFF \
      -DSPHINX_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=OFF \
      -DSPHINX_OUTPUT_MAN=OFF \
      -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=OFF \
      -DLLVM_ENABLE_Z3_SOLVER=OFF \
      -DLLVM_ENABLE_ZLIB=ON \
      -DLLVM_AMDGPU_ALLOW_NPI_TARGETS=ON \
      -DCLANG_DEFAULT_PIE_ON_LINUX=0 \
      -DCLANG_DEFAULT_LINKER=lld \
      -DCLANG_DEFAULT_RTLIB=compiler-rt \
      -DCLANG_DEFAULT_UNWINDLIB=libgcc \
      -DSANITIZER_AMDGPU=OFF \
      -DPACKAGE_VENDOR="AMD" \
      -DCLANG_LINK_FLANG_LEGACY=ON \
      -DCMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH=TRUE \
      -DCMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH=TRUE \
      -DFLANG_INCLUDE_DOCS=OFF \
      ../llvm && ninja install && cd ../../ && rm -rf llvm-project/build
      ```
      The following options can also be considered when building LLVM:
      - `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` will build LLVM with shared libraries instead of static. This option is very useful for
        development builds of Luthier, especially when building the LLVM project with debug information.
      - `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` can be set to `Debug` or `RelWithDebInfo` to build LLVM with debug information. Building
        with `Debug` also enables the LLVM's debugging macros and logging utilities.
      - `-DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS` manually enables or disables assertion in LLVM. Enabling it in development builds 
        is recommended.
      - `-DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=ON` and `-DLLVM_INSTALL_GTEST=ON` will install 
        [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) as well as all internal utility binaries of LLVM, both
        required when running Luthier tests.
      Refer to [LLVM's CMake documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html) for more information on LLVM build flags. 
   3. Configure, build, and install the AMD device libraries under the `amd/` folder of ROCm's LLVM:
      ```bash
      cd llvm-project/amd/device-libs && mkdir build && cd build &&  \
      cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/luthier/  \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/luthier/" ../ && ninja install &&
      cd ../../../ && 
      rm -rf llvm-project/amd/device-libs/build/
      ```
3. clone the Luthier project and build it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/matinraayai/luthier && cd luthier && mkdir build && \
   cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/luthier;/opt/rocm" -G Ninja \
   -DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER=/opt/luthier/llvm/bin/clang++ \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
   -DCMAKE_HIP_FLAGS="-O3" .. && ninja
   ```
   Notable flags:
   - `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` can be set to `Debug` or `RelWithDebInfo` to emit debug information in the compiled targets.
   - `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` should specify `/opt/luthier` after `/opt/rocm` to ensure Luthier-related packages are
     given precedence over their ROCm-shipped counterparts.
   - `DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER` must point to the `clang++` of Luthier, not the one shipped with ROCm.
   - `DLLVM_DIR` can be set to `/opt/luthier/llvm/lib/cmake/llvm/` to force CMake use the Luthier LLVM.
   - `-DLUTHIER_LLVM_SRC_DIR` can be set to point to the source code of Luthier LLVM cloned in the earlier steps. 
   - `-DCMAKE_HIP_FLAGS` should be `"-O3"`, to force CMake to emit optimized device bitcode/binary. For now unoptimized
     tool device binaries are not supported in Luthier.
