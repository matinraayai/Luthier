# Luthier Compiler Plugins
This project contains LLVM compiler plugins of Luthier. For now, it only contains the 
`EmbedInstrumentationModuleBitcodePass`, used by Luthier dynamic instrumentation tools during compilation. 

In the future, this project will also contain other compiler plugins, e.g. a static instrumentation compiler plugin.

Refer to the [Build Instructions](../docs/2.build.md) on how to build this with the Luthier tooling project.
